# Expected events for rules_custom.yml.
# See events_basics.txt for the format.

# There should be a series of such "fake" events for each memory allocation
# but it is enough for now to match at least one such series. 
# Let us pick the allocation of the data buffer in kedr_common_target.ko:
# its size is known in advance.

# Events from the pre-handler:
alloc 4000 0x10
alloc 4096 0x11
alloc 8192 0x12

# Event from the post-handler:
alloc 4000 addr_any
