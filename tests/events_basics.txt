# Expected events.
#
# Format:
#   alloc <min_size> <addrN>
#   free <addrN>
# <min_size> - the size of the allocated memory block should be equal to or
# greater than this.
# <addrN> - a symbolic name for an address, returned or used.
# We cannot know the addresses of the memory blocks in advance, so we use
# symbolic names for that instead, e.g. "addr1", "addr5", etc. This way, we
# can check that the same address is used in the events corresponding to
# "alloc 320 addr1" and "free addr1".

alloc 320 addr1
alloc 4000 addr2
free addr2
free addr1
