# Expected events.
#
# Format:
#   alloc <min_size> <addrN>
#   free <addrN>
#
# <min_size> - the size of the allocated memory block should be equal to or
# greater than this.
#
# <addrN> - a hexadecimal value (if prefixed with "0x") of an address
# returned or used or its symbolic name.
# Most of the time, we cannot know the addresses of the memory blocks in
# advance, so we can use symbolic names for that instead, e.g. "addr1",
# "addr5", etc. This way, we can check that the same address is used in the
# events corresponding to "alloc 320 addr1" and "free addr1".
#
# In the special cases when we expect a particular address, e.g. 0xabcd,
# we can specify it exactly: "alloc 1 0xabcd".


# 320 : sizeof(struct cfake_dev) * 2. May change in different kernels.
# Should the tests start failing because of this, it will be needed to
# choose a smaller <min_size> here.
alloc 320 addr1

alloc 4000 addr2
free addr2
free addr1
